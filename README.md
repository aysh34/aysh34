# Hi, I'm Ayesha Saleem

CS undergrad at Emerson University, working on **Natural Language Processing** and **Computer Vision** projects. I'm genuinely curious about how machine learning works under the hood. Most of my time is spent building projects, reading research papers, and improving how things work. I'm open to research opportunities and collaborations in **ML/DL**.


Currently, I'm diving into **NLP** and **CV** applications, experimenting with **transfer learning**, and exploring **generative AI**. When I commit to something, I see it through.


I publish notebooks on **Kaggle** and host projects on **GitHub**. I've built several projects applying **machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques to real problems. My main tools include **Python**, **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, **Scikit-learn**, and other standard data science libraries.
