# Hi, I’m Ayesha

I am a Computer Science undergraduate at **Emerson University**, focused on **Natural Language Processing** and **Computer Vision**. I build and study machine learning models to understand how and why they work, not just to improve their performance.

## Highlights

- Participated in the **[CALICO Informatics Competition Fall 2025](https://github.com/aysh34/CALICO-Informatics-Competition-Fall-2025)**, solving algorithmic and logic-based challenges under strict time constraints.  
- Developed a data-driven **Earth Observation Model** for the **[NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025](https://github.com/aysh34/2025-NASA-Space-Apps-Challenge)**, integrating satellite data with machine learning pipelines.  
- Secured **1st position globally** in **[Harvard CS50x Puzzle Day 2025](https://github.com/aysh34/aysh34/blob/main/assets/CS50x%20Puzzle%20Day%202025.png)**, showcasing logical reasoning and problem-solving skills.  
- Recognized as a **[Kaggle Expert](https://www.kaggle.com/ayeshasal89)** with 15+ published machine learning notebooks, ranked among the **top 4%** of contributors worldwide.

## Contact

I am seeking opportunities for **research collaboration or project work** in **Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision**, particularly those emphasizing methodological rigor and interpretability. You can reach me at **ayeshasaleem853@gmail.com**.

**Fun Fact:** I enjoy exploring how mathematical intuition translates into model behavior, the bridge between **theory and implementation**.
