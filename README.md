## Contact

I'm looking for **research or project opportunities** in **Machine Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision**.

**Email:** [ayeshasaleem853@gmail.com](mailto:ayeshasaleem853@gmail.com)  

**Fun Fact:** I tend to listen more than I talk, and that carries into my work. I pay close attention to the details, whether debugging code or tuning hyperparameters.
