# Hi, I'm Ayesha Saleem

CS undergrad at Emerson University, working on NLP and computer vision projects. I'm genuinely curious about how machine learning works under the hood. Most of my time goes into building projects, reading papers, and figuring out how to make things work better.

## What I'm Working On

Right now, I'm diving deep into NLP and CV applications, experimenting with transfer learning, and exploring generative AI. When I commit to something, I see it through.

## Projects & Skills

I've built several projects applying ML and DL techniques to real problems. Check out my repositories to see what I've been working on. I work with Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and the usual data science tools.

## Collaboration & Sharing

I'm open to research opportunities and collaborations. I share what I learn through Kaggle (where I'm a Notebook Expert) and project documentation. I also enjoy problem-solving challenges, and recently won Harvard CS50 Puzzle Day 2025.
