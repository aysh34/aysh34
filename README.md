<h1> <strong>Hi, I'm Ayesha Saleem</strong> </h1> 
</div> 

Iâ€™m a Computer Science undergrad with a strong passion for Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I enjoy building projects that transform data into impactful solutions. My current focus is on Deep Learning and Large Language Models, particularly how they can address real-world challenges and inspire new directions in AI research. My technical skills and persistence in solving complex data-driven problems have earned me recognition as a Kaggle Expert. I'm always excited to collaborate on research, applied ML, and innovative AI projects. Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:ayeshasaleem853@gmail.com). I'd love to discuss new opportunities and ideas!
