# Hi, I’m Ayesha 👋

CS undergraduate at **Emerson University** focused on **Natural Language Processing** and **Computer Vision**. I enjoy building ML systems and exploring model behavior, not just to make models work, but to understand *why* they work.

## 🏆 Achievements & Competitions

- Competed in the **[CALICO Informatics Competition Fall 2025](https://github.com/aysh34/CALICO-Informatics-Competition-Fall-2025)**, solving algorithmic and logic-based problems and strengthening my approach to problem-solving under time constraints.
- Built a data-driven **Earth observation model** for the **[NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025](https://github.com/aysh34/2025-NASA-Space-Apps-Challenge)** using satellite data, Pandas, and TensorFlow.
- Placed **1st globally** in **Harvard CS50x Puzzle Day 2025**, demonstrating strong logical reasoning and algorithmic skills.
- Contributed as a **[Kaggle Expert](https://www.kaggle.com/ayeshasal89)** with 15+ notebooks on ML topics ranked in the **top 4%** globally.


## What I’m Looking For

Open to research collaborations, internships, or project contributions in **Machine Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision**. I enjoy projects that require both rigorous experimentation and interpretable results.

### Fun Fact

I love exploring how mathematical intuition translates into model behavior, the bridge between **theory and implementation**.
