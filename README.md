# Hi, I’m Ayesha

I am a Computer Science undergraduate at **Emerson University**, focused on **Natural Language Processing** and **Computer Vision**. I build and study machine learning models to understand how and why they work, not just to improve their performance.

## Highlights

- Recognized as a **[Kaggle Expert](https://www.kaggle.com/ayeshasal89)** with 15+ published machine learning notebooks, ranked among the **top 4%** of contributors worldwide.
- Awarded a merit-based undergraduate scholarship (Honhaar) at Emerson University for sustained academic excellence, maintaining a 3.88/4.0 CGPA in the Computer Science program.
- Developed a data-driven **Earth Observation Model** for the **[NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025](https://github.com/aysh34/2025-NASA-Space-Apps-Challenge)**, integrating satellite data with machine learning pipelines.  
- Participated in the **[CALICO Informatics Competition 2025](https://github.com/aysh34/CALICO-Informatics-Competition-Fall-2025)** hosted by UC Berkeley, solving logic-based challenges under strict time constraints .  
- Secured **1st position globally** in **[Harvard CS50x Puzzle Day 2025](https://github.com/aysh34/aysh34/blob/main/assets/CS50x%20Puzzle%20Day%202025.png)**, showcasing logical reasoning and problem-solving skills.  
- Solved 220+ Data Structures & Algorithms problems on **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/ayesha_saleem9/)**.
  
## Contact
