<h1> <strong>Hi, I'm Ayesha Saleem</strong> </h1> 
</div> 

I am a Computer Science undergraduate with interests in **Machine Learning**. I enjoy exploring research questions by building projects that transform data into impactful solutions. My current focus is on **Deep Learning** and **Large Language Models**, particularly how they can address real-world challenges and inspire new directions in AI research. My recognition as a **Kaggle Expert** highlights both my technical skills and my persistence in solving complex data-driven problems. I'm always excited to collaborate on **research, applied ML, and innovative AI projects**. Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:ayeshasaleem853@gmail.com). I'd love to discuss new opportunities and ideas!

**Here are some of my recent projects**
- **[Parkinson's Disease Detection via Speech Analysis](https://github.com/aysh34/Parkinsons-Disease-Detection)**  
- **[Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/aysh34/OncoPredict-AI)**
