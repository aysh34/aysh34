<h1> <strong>Hi, I'm Ayesha Saleem</strong> </h1> 
</div> 

I'm passionate about machine learning and deep learning, with a particular focus on how these technologies can solve real-world problems and open new research directions. As an undergraduate Computer Science student at Emerson University and a Kaggle Expert, I actively apply my technical skills to data-driven challenges.

I'm always eager to connect with others who share similar interests in ML/DL. Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:ayeshasaleem853@gmail.com). I'd love to discuss new opportunities, collaborate on projects, or explore innovative ideas together.

My experience spans both academic coursework and practical competitions, giving me insight into both theoretical foundations and applied problem-solving. I'm particularly drawn to research opportunities that push the boundaries of what's possible with machine learning.
