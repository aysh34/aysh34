<h1> <strong>Hi, I'm Ayesha Saleem</strong> </h1> 
</div> 

I'm passionate about machine learning and deep learning, with a particular focus on how these technologies can solve real world problems and open new research directions. As an undergraduate Computer Science student at Emerson University and a Kaggle Expert, I actively apply my technical skills to data-driven challenges.

My experience spans both academic coursework and practical competitions, giving me insight into both theoretical foundations and applied problem-solving. I'm particularly drawn to research opportunities that push the boundaries of what's possible with machine learning. 
I'm always eager to connect with others who share similar interests in ML/DL. Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:ayeshasaleem853@gmail.com).
