# Ayesha Saleem

3rd-year Computer Science student at Emerson University, working at the intersection of language and vision in AI, building models, understanding them deeply, and finding where they can be genuinely useful.

I tend to listen more than I talk. That carries into my work, close attention to details, whether debugging code or tuning hyperparameters.

## Work & Interests

**Machine Learning · Deep Learning · NLP · Computer Vision**

I'm drawn to problems where models need to understand context: multimodal systems, retrieval-augmented generation, and representation learning. I enjoy reading papers, reproducing results, and building small things that work well.
