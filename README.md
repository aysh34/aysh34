# **Hi, I'm Ayesha**

CS undergrad at Emerson University, working on **Natural Language Processing** and **Computer Vision** projects. I'm genuinely curious about how machine learning works under the hood. Most of my time is spent building projects, reading research papers, and improving how things work. I publish notebooks on **Kaggle** and host projects on **GitHub**. I've built several projects applying **machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques to real problems.


## **Recent Highlights**

- Took part in the **[NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025](https://github.com/aysh34/2025-NASA-Space-Apps-Challenge)**, developing a data-driven **Earth observation model** using **satellite data, Pandas, and TensorFlow**.  
- Participated in **Harvard CS50x Puzzle Day 2025** and achieved 1st place globally through strong logical reasoning and algorithmic problem-solving.  
- Contributed to the **[Kaggle community](https://www.kaggle.com/ayeshasal89)** as an **Expert**, publishing 15+ machine learning notebooks with **Python, PyTorch, and scikit-learn**, ranking in the top 4% worldwide.  


## **Tech Stack**

PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, Medical Imaging Processing, NLP, CV, Transfer Learning


## **Looking For**

Open to research collaborations and project contributions in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**, particularly in **Natural Language Processing** and **Computer Vision**.
